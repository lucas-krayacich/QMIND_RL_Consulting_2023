## Deep Q-Networks (DQN) Research Paper

### Introduction
Our research paper delves into the application of Deep Q-Networks (DQN) in mastering Atari games. 

### Boiler-Plate DQN Template
We created a boiler-plate template for a basic DQN which has been designed to be easily tunable and customizable.

### Individual Exploration
Each team member explored a unique Atari game, customizing the DQN template through parameter tuning and experimentation to optimize performance.

### Showcase of Versatility
Through these efforts, we showcase the versatility of DQN in handling various game dynamics and also have an accessible and hands-on way for members to learn about reinforcement learning.

### Learning Tools
Although no new ground was broken by this project, we created a series of very effective learning tools and interactive ways to become involved with RL.
